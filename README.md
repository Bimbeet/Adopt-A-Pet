## Unsolved Problems
In the organization feature, when using Next or Previous in the case where it hits the beginning or the end of the array it's using, it sometimes skips an item. (usually index 0) I think it is rendering before the index updates, or my loop is slightly off.
There are also minor error messages that do not break the code, I should think about how to refactor these.
